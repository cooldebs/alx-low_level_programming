0x18. C - Dynamic libraries
A library is a group of pre-compiled piece of code that can be reused in the program.
In simplified terms, it is a way of programming.

Libraries can be grouped into two types:
- Dynamic library/Shared library.
- Static library.

-- For static libraries, while reusable in multiple programs, are locked into a program at compile time.
-- Dynamic libraries, on the other hand, exist as separate files outside of the executable file.
